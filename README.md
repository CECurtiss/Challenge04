## Javascript, CSS, and HTML Coding Quiz

### Application
This project involved making a quiz that would track high scores and initials using local storage. 

I generated 8 questions that would randomize and display correct and incorrect depending on the button selected with a given answer. Incorrect answers would deduct
from the players total score, which was based off of the time left. The player can then enter in their initials to post their score on a leaderboard.
